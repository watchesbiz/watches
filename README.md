## 🔍 Why TPD Matters
Incorrect winding can lead to accuracy drift or mechanical wear. Most luxury timepieces require between **650 and 950 TPD**. Using an unshielded winder can also expose your movement to **Stray Magnetic Fields**, the silent killer of hairspring precision.

==================
PART 1: HOROLOGICAL DATA DICTIONARY AND SCHEMA SPECIFICATIONS
To ensure seamless integration with automated scripts, third-party apps, and home automation platforms, every caliber in this repository is normalized using the following raw technical schema:

FIELD DEFINITIONS:

brand: The legal trademark name of the watch manufacturer (e.g., Rolex, Omega).

caliber: The specific alphanumeric identifier of the mechanical movement.

direction: The required dynamic rotation vector. Valid entries are:

CW  (Clockwise)

CCW (Counter-Clockwise)

BOTH (Bi-directional winding efficiency)

min_tpd: The minimum continuous daily rotation threshold required to maintain the torque of the mainspring.

max_tpd: The maximum safe operational limit before causing excessive mechanical wear on the slipping attachment.

optimal_tpd: The calculated programmatic sweet spot for daily kinetic input.

To interact with a live, searchable UI execution layer built on top of this exact raw schema, reference the official production deployment:

PART 2: HARDWARE TROUBLESHOOTING - MITIGATING WORKSTATION EMI
If your mechanical timepiece experiences sudden rate acceleration (gaining 15 to 60 minutes per day) while sitting on a development desk, the oscillator is likely undergoing transient magnetization.

DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOL FOR DEVELOPERS:

Identify Localized Flux Sources: Laptops with magnetic lid sensors, desktop audio monitors, magnetic tablet mounts, and induction charging pads emit fields far exceeding the 60 Gauss limit specified by ISO 764.

Isolate the Culprit: Move the mechanical movement at least 20 centimeters away from consumer electronic chassis.

Apply Passive Defense: Traditional metallic hairsprings require physical shielding to survive modern desktop EMI. Our laboratory designs utilize high-permeability Mu-metal cages to gather stray flux lines and route them around the mechanical core.

For precise attenuation formulas, multi-layer shielding thickness tables, and detailed laboratory evaluations regarding METAS 15,000 Gauss standards, you can read the complete documentation directly in our Anti-Magnetic Engineering White Paper PDF.

📊 Core Caliber TPD Specs & Technical Notes
Rolex (Cal. 3235) — TPD: 650 | Direction: Both | Hairspring: Paramagnetic blue Parachrom | Notes: Requires bi-directional winding; highly resistant but benefits from isolated storage.

Omega (Cal. 8900) — TPD: 720 | Direction: Both | Hairspring: Silicon (Si14) | Notes: Master Chronometer certified; virtually immune to daily magnetic fields.

Patek Philippe (Cal. 240) — TPD: 800 | Direction: CCW | Hairspring: Spiromax (Silicon-based) | Notes: Uni-directional counter-clockwise winding only. Precision micro-rotor requires stable TPD control.

Audemars Piguet (Cal. 4302) — TPD: 800 | Direction: Both | Hairspring: Ferrous Alloy | Notes: Standard magnetic resistance. High asset value requires active anti-magnetic shielding in storage.
